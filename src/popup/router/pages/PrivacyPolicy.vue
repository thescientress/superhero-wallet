            determine the purposes and means of <strong>processing</strong> of
            <strong>personal data</strong> and does not conduct any

            independently or with others, conduct any operations or set of operations which is

            &nbsp;The <strong>Wallet</strong> is a <strong>blockchain</strong> based application on
            which an <strong>account address</strong> is generated or an <strong>account</strong>
            <strong>name</strong> can be claimed through the
            <strong>&AElig;ternity Naming System</strong> for <strong>USER</strong> identification.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <strong>account addresses</strong> and the <strong>names</strong> can be treated as
            indirect identifiers. An indirect identifier is a value which cannot be used alone to
            identify a data subject, however, could be identifying if combined with other indirect
            identifiers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The &AElig;ternity</strong> network is a public and permissionless blockchain,
            in which everyone can participate and validate (see definition for
            <strong>Validator</strong> in <strong>TERMS OF USE</strong>).
            <strong>USERS</strong> understand and accept that all persons can see in the
            <strong>Wallet</strong> and the <strong>blockchain</strong> the indirect identifiers
            related to transactions &ndash; namely <strong>account addresses</strong> and
            <strong>names</strong> generated via <strong>&AElig;ternity</strong>
            <strong>Naming System</strong>. The above-mentioned information might be used to
            identify a natural person. Therefore, <strong>USERS</strong> accept and agree that
            <strong>Superhero</strong> does not act in full capacity as
            <strong>Data Controller</strong> in the meaning established in Regulation (EU) 2016/679
            of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of
            natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement
            of such data (&ldquo;<strong>GDPR</strong>&rdquo;). <strong>USERS</strong> understand
            and accept that by using the open-source blockchain technology incorporated in
            <strong>the application</strong>, they provide their personal data- identifiable or
